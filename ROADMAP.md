# Play Fast Notes — Web Roadmap

_Last updated: 2026-05-02_

Granular roadmap for the web companion. Sibling to the iPad app at
`../learn-fast-notes/`. Product direction, vocabulary, and design principles
live in `../learn-fast-notes/ROADMAP.md` — this document only tracks
implementation milestones for the web surface.

---

## Vision

`playfastnotes.com` — a browser-based companion that lets working musicians
and teachers (and students who rise to the tool) practice with the same
guided strategies as the iPad app. Web is the universal fallback for anyone
without an iPad, and eventually the surface where Stripe-direct subscriptions
happen.

iPad is the design north star; web follows. They share a Supabase backend for
auth, practice log, and (later) subscription state.

## Tech stack

- **Framework**: Expo Web (React Native Web) — lets us copy iPad components
  and adapt minimally rather than rewriting in plain React.
- **Backend**: Supabase (Postgres + RLS + Auth + Storage).
- **Auth**: email + password (magic link disabled for testing-phase friction;
  may revisit at Phase 4.4).
- **Hosting**: Vercel, GitHub auto-deploy from `master`.
- **Domain**: `playfastnotes.com`.

## Current status

### ✅ Done

- **Phase 1 — bootstrap**: fresh Expo SDK 54 project, web platform configured,
  `@supabase/supabase-js` installed, design tokens + primitives copied from
  iPad, repos mirroring iPad signatures, schema.sql with RLS policies.
- **Phase 2 chunk 1 — auth + library**: useSession-based auth gate, sign-in
  screen with email + password, signup-or-signin smart Continue, single-tab
  layout matching iPad, library v1 (folders + pieces + search + empty state).
- **Phase 2 chunk 2 — first practice flow**: upload (title + composer only),
  piece detail (strategy picker), Tempo Ladder v1 (step mode only).
- **Phase 2 chunk 3 — image storage + crop**: Supabase Storage bucket `pieces`
  with RLS, browser file picker swapped in for the upload form, cropper UI
  (`InlineCropper` overlay), thumbnails rendered in library and piece detail.
  Crop save **cache-busts the storage URL with `?v=<Date.now()>`** so re-cropped
  JPEGs display the new bytes (browsers and the Supabase CDN otherwise serve
  the stale path).
- **Phase 2 chunk 4 — practice strategy parity**:
  - **Tempo Ladder full parity**: cluster mode + step mode, `BpmStepper`,
    `useTempoLadderSession` hook, `FloatingSlowClickUpControls` (drag +
    pinch), `CelebrationModal`, `PracticeLogNotePrompt`, subdivision support
    in `useMetronome`.
  - **Interleaved Click-Up**: marking → config → playing flow,
    `ScoreWithMarkers` with tap-to-mark, `useClickUpSession`,
    `FloatingClickUpControls`, `TempoConfigFields`.
  - **Rhythmic Variation (Rhythm patterns only path)**: 2-step bottom sheet
    on piece detail, grouping picker (3-8), `AbcStaffView` (abcjs via CDN
    script tag, no npm dep), `FloatingMetronome`, `FloatingRhythmCard`,
    rhythm-loop scheduler in `useMetronome` (`startRhythmLoop` /
    `stopRhythmLoop` / `toggleRhythmLoop`).
- **Phase 2 chunk 5 — log views**: per-piece **Practice History** screen
  with section list grouped by date and edit/delete entry; **library-wide
  Practice Log** with By date / By folder grouping, edit/delete entries.
- **Phase 2 chunk 6 — multi-page passage**: two-page composite uploads
  (`/multi-page` route), per-page crop via `InlineCropper`, canvas-stacked
  composite save, `dismissAll` + push so back-from-piece returns to library.
- **Phase 2 chunk 7 — settings**: settings screen ported.
- **Phase 2 chunk 8 — Exercise Builder (Rhythmic Variation, Exercise Builder
  branch)** shipped in 4 slices:
  - Slice A: `rhythm-list` (saved-exercises list with Edit/Rename/Delete + new-exercise
    PromptModal). Reached from the Rhythmic Variation modal on piece detail.
  - Slice B: builder Setup phase — score thumb, Instrument / Key / Clef
    `DropdownField`s, `GroupingPicker` (3-8). Selections persisted to
    `exercises.config_json`. Ports `lib/music/pitch.ts` (instruments, clefs,
    key signatures, transposition, key-aware spelling).
  - Slice C: builder Entry phase — full 88-key `PianoKeyboard` (`onPressIn`
    so taps fire instantly), `PitchStaff` powered by `buildPitchAbc`,
    `NoteCardEditor` (enharmonic respell, courtesy accidental, insert
    before/after, delete), transport row (Play / Switch sharps↔flats /
    Undo / Clear / Generate). `useMetronome` extended with `playPitch`,
    `playPitchSequence`, `playPitchRhythm`, `stopPitchSequence`. Pitches
    persisted to `exercises.config_json` (debounced 400 ms).
  - Slice D: builder Generate phase — one row per rhythm pattern with
    a row header (`#71 · 3/4`, rhythm tokens) and a wrapped pitched staff
    rendered by an extended `AbcStaffView` (`wrap`, `preferredMeasuresPerLine`,
    `fallbackText`, `onNoteTap`, `activeNoteIndex`). PDF export mirrors iPad's
    `expo-print` pipeline by opening a popup window with `lib/export/buildExerciseHtml.ts`
    and triggering `window.print()`. Per-pattern playback uses
    `playPitchRhythm`. EDIT button returns to Entry; DONE opens
    `PracticeLogNotePrompt` and logs a `rhythmic` practice entry tied to the
    exercise; auto-routes to Generate when re-opening an exercise that has
    saved pitches.
- **Phase 2 chunk 9 — Chunking**: ported `piece/[id]/chunking.tsx` with the
  How-to-chunk help modal and DONE flow that logs a `chunking` practice entry.
  Reached via the Chunking pill on piece detail (replaced the iPad's
  `Unguided ▾` since chunking is currently the only unguided strategy on
  web).
- **Vercel deploy + `playfastnotes.com`**: live, auto-deploys on push to
  `master`.

### 🚧 Next up (in priority order)

1. **Folder Log** (`folder-log`) — log filtered to one folder; shares most
   logic with Library Log.
2. **Serial Practice (Interleaved)** — the iPad's `interleaved.tsx`. Complex;
   the iPad's `_activeSession` module-level state needs a state-management
   plan first.
3. **Library polish v2**: edit mode (rename, move, delete, reorder), folder
   creation, move-to picker. Up/down arrows first; defer drag-and-drop.
4. **Self-Led strategies index** (Phase 2 of iPad roadmap).
5. **Search across pieces and exercises**.

### ⏳ Polish for shipped screens

- **rhythm-list edit mode**: drag-to-reorder uses Reanimated long-press +
  pan on iPad. Up/down arrows first on web; defer drag-and-drop.
- **Exercise Builder PDF**: PDF export currently strips per-exercise time
  signature and rhythm-token labels (intentional, per request) — only the
  pattern number remains. Revisit if the labels need to come back.
- **AI score-scan + mic-based pitch entry** (the two non-keyboard pitch entry
  modes from iPad's Exercise Builder) — deferred. Browser file-input is the
  permanent fallback; mic recording is feasible but unprioritised.

### ⏳ Later

- **Practice timers** (the iPad's `GlobalTimerTray` / `PracticeTimersContext`)
  — already wired; tweak/expand if needed.
- **Responsive layout polish for phone-sized browsers** (currently
  iPad-shaped).
- **Audio recording / pitch detection** — defer; browser audio recording is
  feasible but not prioritized for the testing surface.

### 🛑 Deferred (rationale)

- **Stripe subscriptions** — Phase 4.4 of the iPad roadmap. The
  `subscriptions` table is created empty so wiring drops in cleanly later.
  Deferred until the testing phase produces enough conviction to charge.
- **Practice-log sync between iPad and web** — Phase 4.3 of the iPad
  roadmap. The iPad continues using local SQLite for now; cross-surface sync
  is its own project.
- **Document scanner** — no web equivalent for the iPad's
  `react-native-document-scanner-plugin`. The browser file picker is the
  permanent web equivalent; the camera-scan affordance is iPad-only.

## Phasing relative to iPad ROADMAP

The iPad roadmap names this entire effort "Phase 4 — Web version migration."
Within Phase 4 there are sub-phases:

- **Phase 4.1** (port design tokens) — ✅ done.
- **Phase 4.2** (rebuild web UI to match) — ~95% complete. All single-piece
  practice screens are functional (Tempo Ladder, Click-Up, Rhythmic
  Variation patterns-only path, Rhythmic Variation Exercise Builder all 4
  slices, Chunking, Practice History). Remaining: folder-log, Serial
  Practice (interleaved), library polish.
- **Phase 4.3** (shared backend) — partially done. Auth + per-user data
  isolation work; cross-surface sync deferred.
- **Phase 4.4** (Stripe subscriptions) — not started. Schema slot exists.
