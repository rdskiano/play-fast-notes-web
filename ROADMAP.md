# Play Fast Notes — Web Roadmap

_Last updated: 2026-05-01_

Granular roadmap for the web companion. Sibling to the iPad app at
`../learn-fast-notes/`. Product direction, vocabulary, and design principles
live in `../learn-fast-notes/ROADMAP.md` — this document only tracks
implementation milestones for the web surface.

---

## Vision

`playfastnotes.com` — a browser-based companion that lets working musicians
and teachers (and students who rise to the tool) practice with the same
guided strategies as the iPad app. Web is the universal fallback for anyone
without an iPad, and eventually the surface where Stripe-direct subscriptions
happen.

iPad is the design north star; web follows. They share a Supabase backend for
auth, practice log, and (later) subscription state.

## Tech stack

- **Framework**: Expo Web (React Native Web) — lets us copy iPad components
  and adapt minimally rather than rewriting in plain React.
- **Backend**: Supabase (Postgres + RLS + Auth + Storage).
- **Auth**: email + password (magic link disabled for testing-phase friction;
  may revisit at Phase 4.4).
- **Hosting**: Vercel, GitHub auto-deploy from `master`.
- **Domain**: `playfastnotes.com`.

## Current status

### ✅ Done

- **Phase 1 — bootstrap**: fresh Expo SDK 54 project, web platform configured,
  `@supabase/supabase-js` installed, design tokens + primitives copied from
  iPad, repos mirroring iPad signatures, schema.sql with RLS policies.
- **Phase 2 chunk 1 — auth + library**: useSession-based auth gate, sign-in
  screen with email + password, signup-or-signin smart Continue, single-tab
  layout matching iPad, library v1 (folders + pieces + search + empty state).
- **Phase 2 chunk 2 — first practice flow**: upload (title + composer only),
  piece detail (strategy picker), Tempo Ladder v1 (step mode only).
- **Phase 2 chunk 3 — image storage + crop**: Supabase Storage bucket `pieces`
  with RLS, browser file picker swapped in for the upload form, cropper UI
  (`InlineCropper` overlay), thumbnails rendered in library and piece detail.
  Crop save **cache-busts the storage URL with `?v=<Date.now()>`** so re-cropped
  JPEGs display the new bytes (browsers and the Supabase CDN otherwise serve
  the stale path).
- **Phase 2 chunk 4 — practice strategy parity**:
  - **Tempo Ladder full parity**: cluster mode + step mode, `BpmStepper`,
    `useTempoLadderSession` hook, `FloatingSlowClickUpControls` (drag +
    pinch), `CelebrationModal`, `PracticeLogNotePrompt`, subdivision support
    in `useMetronome`.
  - **Interleaved Click-Up**: marking → config → playing flow,
    `ScoreWithMarkers` with tap-to-mark, `useClickUpSession`,
    `FloatingClickUpControls`, `TempoConfigFields`.
  - **Rhythmic Variation (Rhythm patterns only path)**: 2-step bottom sheet
    on piece detail, grouping picker (3-8), `AbcStaffView` (abcjs via CDN
    script tag, no npm dep), `FloatingMetronome`, `FloatingRhythmCard`,
    rhythm-loop scheduler in `useMetronome` (`startRhythmLoop` /
    `stopRhythmLoop` / `toggleRhythmLoop`).
- **Phase 2 chunk 5 — log views**: per-piece **Practice History** screen
  with section list grouped by date and edit/delete entry; **library-wide
  Practice Log** with By date / By folder grouping, edit/delete entries.
- **Phase 2 chunk 6 — multi-page passage**: two-page composite uploads
  (`/multi-page` route), per-page crop via `InlineCropper`, canvas-stacked
  composite save, `dismissAll` + push so back-from-piece returns to library.
- **Phase 2 chunk 7 — settings**: settings screen ported.
- **Vercel deploy + `playfastnotes.com`**: live, auto-deploys on push to
  `master`.

### 🚧 Next up (in priority order)

1. **Chunking** (`piece/[id]/chunking`) — straightforward port; uses score
   markers like Click-Up.
2. **Folder Log** (`folder-log`) — log filtered to one folder; shares most
   logic with Library Log.
3. **Serial Practice (Interleaved)** — the iPad's `interleaved.tsx`. Complex;
   the iPad's `_activeSession` module-level state needs a state-management
   plan first.
4. **Exercise Builder** (`rhythm-builder`, `rhythm-list`) — the second branch
   of the Rhythmic Variation modal that is currently stubbed as "Coming soon
   to web." Generates fully notated exercises from user-entered pitches; the
   most complex remaining port.
5. **Library polish v2**: edit mode (rename, move, delete, reorder), folder
   creation, move-to picker. Up/down arrows first; defer drag-and-drop.
6. **Self-Led strategies index** (Phase 2 of iPad roadmap).
7. **Search across pieces and exercises**.

### ⏳ Later

- **Practice timers** (the iPad's `GlobalTimerTray` / `PracticeTimersContext`)
  — already wired; tweak/expand if needed.
- **Responsive layout polish for phone-sized browsers** (currently
  iPad-shaped).
- **Audio recording / pitch detection** — defer; browser audio recording is
  feasible but not prioritized for the testing surface.

### 🛑 Deferred (rationale)

- **Stripe subscriptions** — Phase 4.4 of the iPad roadmap. The
  `subscriptions` table is created empty so wiring drops in cleanly later.
  Deferred until the testing phase produces enough conviction to charge.
- **Practice-log sync between iPad and web** — Phase 4.3 of the iPad
  roadmap. The iPad continues using local SQLite for now; cross-surface sync
  is its own project.
- **Document scanner** — no web equivalent for the iPad's
  `react-native-document-scanner-plugin`. The browser file picker is the
  permanent web equivalent; the camera-scan affordance is iPad-only.

## Phasing relative to iPad ROADMAP

The iPad roadmap names this entire effort "Phase 4 — Web version migration."
Within Phase 4 there are sub-phases:

- **Phase 4.1** (port design tokens) — ✅ done.
- **Phase 4.2** (rebuild web UI to match) — ~85% complete. ~12 of 14 screens
  functional. Remaining: chunking, folder-log, interleaved, Exercise Builder
  (rhythm-builder + rhythm-list), library polish.
- **Phase 4.3** (shared backend) — partially done. Auth + per-user data
  isolation work; cross-surface sync deferred.
- **Phase 4.4** (Stripe subscriptions) — not started. Schema slot exists.
